The package contains a number of functions which calculate and display marine heat waves and marine cold spells according to the definition provided by Hobday et al. (2016). It is a translation of the original Python implementation written by Eric C. J. Oliver that can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ecjoliver/marineHeatWaves).

The `detect()` function accepts an input time series of daily temperature. It outputs properties of all detected marine heat waves and marine cold spells. The package provides data of observed SST records for three historical MHWs: the 2011 Western Australia event, the 2012 Northwest Atlantic event and the 2003 Mediterranean event.
