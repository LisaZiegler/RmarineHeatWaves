Description: Applies the Hobday et al. (2016) marine heat wave definition to
    an input time series of temperature along with a time vector. It outputs
    properties of all detected marine heat waves. The package provides data
    of observed SST records for three three historical MHWs: the 2011
    Western Australia event, the 2012 Northwest Atlantic event, and the
    2003 Mediterranean event.
